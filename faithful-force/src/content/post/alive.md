## Done
Today I setup this website which is built with Astro framework (with TypeScript). I chose a prebuilt theme to save some time, you need to know that I'm a pro with CSS but I have never used Tailwind before, and I say it's OK üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. 
I also made use of github actions for deployments. 

## Wait for it

I'll use this space to show you some of my work , stay put.
