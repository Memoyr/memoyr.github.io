			My name is Myriam. I'm a software developer. I work in the domain for the past 15 years or so,
			as a front-end developer, for the most part. <br />
			Fun fact: I have never published a blog post! So, why now ? Well, I felt it's time, and, I'm working
			on adding a new branch to my knowledge of computer science: machine learning. I have to say, it's
			a deeply dense subject! It needs a lot of solutions to maximise memory retention and so posting
			to a blog is one. ðŸ¤Ÿ
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-base sm:text-base">
			As I learn, I also gain meta-knowledge, apart of the technical ones, some of them are: how to
			take better notes, new methods for increasing my own capacity for memorisation and finally
			communicate & share my knowledge.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-base sm:text-base">
			This space will contain some of the latest interesting subjects my studies covers and will
			certainly evolve. I hope you enjoy!
