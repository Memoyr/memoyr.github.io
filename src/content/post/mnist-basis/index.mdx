# Starting point

Computer vision is an important branch of machine learning and It's a great place to start learning the core principles of the domain.
To create a model for MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is in some sort the hello world exercise for that branch.
MNIST is a database of 60,000 small square 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

You can find below along with my [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mindgspl/exercise-mnist), the model and the [demo page](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mgspl/mnist_basic) of the result.
