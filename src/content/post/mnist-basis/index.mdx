# Starting point

Computer vision is an important branch of machine learning and it is a great place to start learning the core principles of the domain.
To create a machine learning model with MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is, for some sort, the hello world exercise of image recognition.
MNIST is a database of 60,000 small square 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits and one common goal we can give to the model is to give the hability to recognize/predict any of the ten numerical digits (0-9) starting from an image as input.

You'll find below this text, my [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mindgspl/exercise-mnist), the model and the [demo page](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mgspl/mnist_basic) of the result of my exercise.
