# Fun

I have collected data from a very small dataset of currently available jobs in the field of Machine Learning and fed them into LangChain.

LangChain can operates by invoking OpenAI's GPT-4 under the hood in an automated manner. In this project, the two services exchange responses based on a task I have designed, which involves generating a summary, a list of skills & technologies to proficiently understand, and some suggestions to equip oneself for these potential roles.

The resulting output is intriguing, and I have printed it below. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/Memoyr/data_lab/blob/main/notebooks/langchain-career-path.ipynb).

It is very simple and the magic happens in those few lines of code :

```
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name='gpt-4')

chain = load_summarize_chain(llm,
                             chain_type="map_reduce",
                             map_prompt=map_prompt_template,
                             combine_prompt=combine_prompt_template,
                             verbose=True
                            )

```
