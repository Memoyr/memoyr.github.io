## I'm studying
Over the past few months, I've gained a fundamental understanding of machine learning processes. I've learned how to construct models, grasped the concept of a loss function, and applied gradient descent, among other things. This endeavor has set me on the path to deepen my proficiency in the Python programming language, including its accompanying ML and Data Science libraries.

<p>If practice makes the master, then, let's dive in!</p>

## Notebook

In my recent notebook  I have built a multi-layer perceptron model with the goal to generate new names.
<br>I've added some extra ideas to the original exercise, you can find more about it here below or you try it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mindgspl/exercise-mlp)
