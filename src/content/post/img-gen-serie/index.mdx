## Creation

The scientific process I used for this experiment was not absolute ðŸ˜Ž. It consisted of a trial of a few image generation models, mostly using the same prompt with occasional small variations.

Although these new models are great, you may notice some imperfections in certain elements. However, if you overlook that, my thought is that it is mind-blowing, and the potential is obvious.

I have fallen in love with the results, and at one point, it was hard to stop myself from generating new batches. Suddenly, I caught myself behaving like a kid playing video games who cannot leave the console and go to sleep.

More of this will follow, it's official!

## Astro

I am currently learning [Astro](https://astro.build/), the framework I use to build this website.
It took a bit of time to understand how to create the basic Image Gallery that is visible on this page, and I hope to enhance this component as I progress.

Given my familiarity with Angular and Next.js (React), it does require some amount of time and effort to comprehend the fundamental of workings of Astro.
Nevertheless, I am thoroughly enjoying working with it, and I find the ability to use `.mdx and .md` files to be fast and convenient for my specific needs.

## The results

<Imgs
